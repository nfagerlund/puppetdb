The `/fact-names` endpoint can be used to retrieve all known fact names.

> **Note:** The v4 API is experimental and may change without notice. For stability, we recommend that you use the v3 API instead.

## Routes

### `GET /fact-names`

This will return an alphabetical list of all known fact names, *including* those which are
known only for deactivated nodes.

#### Examples

[Using `curl` from localhost][curl]:

    curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/v4/fact-names

    ["kernel", "operatingsystem", "osfamily", "uptime"]

## Paging

This query endpoint supports paged results via the common PuppetDB paging
query parameters.  For more information, please see the documentation
on [paging][paging].

## Response Format

The response will be in `application/json`, and will contain an alphabetical
JSON array containing fact names. Each fact name will appear only once,
regardless of how many nodes have that fact.

    [<fact>, <fact>, ..., <fact>, <fact>]
